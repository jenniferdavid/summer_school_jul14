<h1>Dynamics</h1>

<p>V-REP's dynamics module currently supports three different physics engines: the <a href="#bullet">Bullet physics library</a>, the <a href="#ode">Open Dynamics Engine</a>, and the <a href="#vortex">Vortex Dynamics engine</a>. At any time, the user is free to quickly switch from one engine to the other according to his/her <a href="simulation.htm">simulation</a> needs. The reason for this diversity in physics engine support is that physics simulation is a complex task, that can be achieved with various degrees of precision, speed, or with support of diverse features:</p>


<li><a name="bullet" id="bullet"></a><a href="http://www.bulletphysics.org">Bullet physics library</a>: an open source physics engine featuring 3D collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and soft body dynamics (feature that is currently not supported in V-REP). It is used in games, and in visual effects in movies. It is often considered as a <em>game physics engine</em>.</li>

<li><a name="ode" id="ode"></a><a href="http://www.ode.org">Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)</a>: an open source physics engine with two main components: rigid body dynamics and collision detection. It has been used in many applications and games. It is often considered as a <em>game physics engine</em>.</li>

<p class=imageLabel>[Open Dynamics Engine]</p>
<br>


<li><a name="vortex" id="vortex"></a><a href="http://www.vxsim.com/">Vortex Dynamics</a>: a closed source, commercial physics engine producing high fidelity physics simulations. Vortex offers real-world parameters (i.e. corresponding to physical units) for a large number of physical properties, making this engine both realistic and precise. Vortex is mainly used in high performance/precision industrial and research applications. The default Vortex plugin for V-REP is a commercial product, and its free version currently supports  simulation during 20 seconds.</li>

<p>The dynamics module allows simulating interactions between <a href="objects.htm">objects</a> that are near to real-world object interactions. It allows objects to fall, collide, bounce back, but it also allows a manipulator to grasp objects, a conveyor belt to drive parts forward, or a vehicle to roll in a realistic fashion over uneven terrain. Following figures illustrate a dynamic simulation:<br>

<p>Unlike many other simulation software packages, V-REP is not a <em>pure</em> dynamics simulator. It can rather be seen as a hybrid simulator that combines kinematics and dynamics in order to obtain the best performance for various simulation scenarios. Nowadays, physics engines are still relying on many approximations and are relatively imprecise and slow, and wherever possible you should try to use kinematics instead (e.g. for robotic manipulators) and only rely on dynamics where otherwise not feasible (e.g. a robotic manipulator's gripper). If you are simulating a mobile robot that is not supposed to collide or physically interact with its environment (which most mobile robots are anyway very rarely supposed to do) and that is operating exclusively on flat ground (which groups the vast majority of mobile robots), then try rather using kinematic or geometric calculations to simulate the robot's movement. The result will be faster and more accurate.<br>

<p>Some results of the dynamics module can be recorded by graph objects. Refer to <a href="graphs.htm">graphs</a> and <a href="dataStreamTypes.htm">graph data stream types</a> for more information about how to record dynamics data.<br>
